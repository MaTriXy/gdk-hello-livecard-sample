Hello Live Card
=======

This sample provides a minimal implementation of a GDK Live Card for
Google Glass. It displays the current system time at about 30 fps :)

This is just something that I hacked up as an experiment. Consider it
a snapshot sample. In other words, it's not actively maintained. It
last worked as of XE12.

better samples, and pictures of puppies. C'mon, what do you have to lose?
